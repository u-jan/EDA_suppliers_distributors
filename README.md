You’ve been tasked with creating a monthly insights package for these suppliers that will provide them data on how they are performing,

## TASK 3


Task 3
Company X works with a distribution partner to store, pick and pack their goods.
They are currently in negotiations to reduce distribution costs by 10% per unit on orders of quantity 3 or more.
Company X wants to understand the downstream impacts on their gross margin as a percentage of monthly sales.
Please use the attached dataset titled ‘Company X - Q3’ to help them.
Note: in this case gross margin is calculated as (Sales Revenue + Shipping Revenue) - (Cost of Goods Sold + Distribution Costs + Shipping Costs). Distribution costs are allocated on a per unit basis and are uniform, regardless of sku sold.

gross margin is calculated as (Sales Revenue + Shipping Revenue) - (Cost of Goods Sold + Distribution Costs + Shipping Costs)

Assumption It is noted that costs are allocated on a per unit basis only for distribution costs. Therefore I will assume all other stated revenues and costs are total per order.
